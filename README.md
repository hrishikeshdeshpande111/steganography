Steganography Tool
This is a Python tool that can hide messages or files inside images and retrieve them later. This tool uses a technique called steganography, which is the practice of hiding information in plain sight.

Usage
To use this tool, you need to save the steganography.py file to your computer. You can then import the hideMessage and retrieveMessage functions from the steganography module in your own Python script and use them to hide and retrieve messages from images.
